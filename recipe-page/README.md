# Frontend Mentor - Recipe page solution

This is a solution to the [Recipe page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview

This is my first complete web page project. Since we don't have the Figma for free users, I tried to get the paddings and margins with GIMP, hope this is close enough !

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This project was a nice transition from what I already have learned with the previous ones, and the first where I encounter some difficulties:
- set space between the ol li bullets and the text
- the kind of table at the bottom...

Feel free to help me on these parts ! Thank you !
